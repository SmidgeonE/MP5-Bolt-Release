# MP5-Bolt-Release

MP5 Thumb Slap
Ever wanted to be able to slap your bolt with your thumb like a professional?

Well now you can!

If your bolt is locked back, once you hold the handguard and PRESS the joystick up, you can release the bolt.

In case you don't quite get it, here is a video demonstration:

It works on all guns with a lockable bolt, such as the G3SG1, and AUG, as well as the MP5.

UPDATE - Now works with streamlined controls - press the TOP key on your joystick to release the bolt.
